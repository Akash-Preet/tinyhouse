# Module 5 Introduction

From modules 1 - 4, we've been focusing on the server portion of our application. We created a server using Node and Express and we set up a GraphQL API with the help of Apollo. We also verified our GraphQL APIs functionality using the GraphQL Playground.

In this module, we'll now switch over to the client portion of Part I of the course. In this module, we're going to:

- Introduce [React](https://reactjs.org/) as the main tool we'll use to build our client application.
- Walkthrough [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to help scaffold a new Webpack bundled React application.
