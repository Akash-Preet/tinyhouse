# Module 1 Introduction

In this module, we'll be creating a [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) server from scratch with the help of the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework. We'll then introduce the benefits of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and integrate TypeScript into our Node server application.

For the details within this module:

- We'll introduce Node and explain how Node is different to other web server technologies.
- Run a simple JavaScript file with Node.
- Create a server with the help of the popular Express package.
- Use [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) as a development tool to help with automatic reloading of our code.
- Introduce TypeScript and explain the benefits of using it.
- Add TypeScript to our server project and see how we're able to compile a TypeScript project to valid JavaScript.
- Install and use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) as our development code linting tool.
- Finally, use mock data to create a GET and POST route within our server to mimic how RESTful APIs are to usually behave.
