# Module 2 Introduction

We've created a RESTful API to interact with our mock data. A common question is why would one need [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)?

GraphQL is a **query language for APIs** and was originally created to help client-side applications dictate the data they need before they request it. We thought the best way to introduce GraphQL would be to compare a real REST and GraphQL API that achieves the same outcome.

In this module, we'll:

- Explain what GraphQL is.
- Compare [Github's REST](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and [Github's GraphQL](https://developer.github.com/v4/) APIs.
- Finally, dive deeper into some core concepts of GraphQL.
