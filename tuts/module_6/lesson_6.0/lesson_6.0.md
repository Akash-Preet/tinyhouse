# Module 6 Introduction

We have a new React project now created. In this module, we'll have our client make API requests to our server using GraphQL.

In detail we'll:

- First, construct a functional React component.
- Use TypeScript to check the props of the component.
- See how we can go about defining the type of the functional component created.
- Create a `fetch()` function to help query our GraphQL API.
- See how TypeScript [generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html) can help abstract the type of retrieved data from the API.
- Finally, use the `fetch()` function we've created to run the `deleteListing` mutation.
