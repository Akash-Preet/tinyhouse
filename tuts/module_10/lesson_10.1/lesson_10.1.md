# Part One Conclusion

Congratulations! You've just finished Part I of this MasterClass. In Part I, we've introduced a series of core technologies to build a full-stack web app. We've introduced [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and even discussed [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). We've also seen how a UI framework can help make our React UI look more presentable.

In Part II of the course, we'll take everything we've learned so far and build a production-ready application. See you there!
